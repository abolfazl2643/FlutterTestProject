I've written this very small app as a work sample for a company that I sent resume to (this is just a 2 days project I will complete it in the Future)

An important tip you should know :
#As you know in some places in the would, FireBase is banned so please change your ip then start the app ,otherwaise you cant sign in  ! 

Features I've used in the app (if you are out of time and want to know how skilled I am !!! ):
#Athentication
#Eplicit animations
#Hive database ( but I removed it !!! so forget about it )
#State Manegment with Provider

Sorry if my code is a mess because I didnt have much time(2 days with a lot of works) to make it better
